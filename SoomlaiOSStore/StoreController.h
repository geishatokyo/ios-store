/**
 * This class is where all the important stuff happens. You can use it to purchase products from Google Play,
 * buy virtual goods, and get notifications on whatever happens.
 *
 * This is the only class you need to initialize in order to use the SOOMLA SDK. If you use the UI,
 * you'll need to also initialize StorefrontActivity.
 *
 * In addition to initializing this class, you'll also have to call storeOpening and
 * storeClosing when you open the store window or close it.
 * IMPORTANT: if you use the SOOMLA storefront (SOOMLA Storefront), than DON'T call these 2 functions. SOOMLA
 * storefront takes care of it for you.
